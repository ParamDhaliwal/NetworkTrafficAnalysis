# NetworkTrafficAnalysis
COMP 8006 - Network Traffic Analysis Report

This project consisted of analyzing network traffic captured on three separate networks over a period of several days, analyzing the raw data, and performing a security audit on the complete data set.

The objective of this report is to analyze the raw data and present a report that will allow the administrator of the network on which the traffic was captured to get an accurate idea of benign as well as anomalous and dangerous network activity in and out of the network.

The data will be provided to you in three directories:

•	Network 1
•	Network 2
•	Network 3

Each directory contains files and directories such as snort data, tcpdump captures, and other miscellaneous logfiles (for each network) captured by a sensors positioned at the perimeter of the network or in some cases on the key server itself.

You are required to provide a summary of all the data in the form of tables and graphs together with some basic statistics. Be particularly vigilant for signs of malicious activity and compromised machines.
